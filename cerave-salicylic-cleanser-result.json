He pairs it with Benzagel 5% Acne Gel, and honestly, it’s been working well to keep the typical teenage skin drama under control. Less redness, fewer breakouts, and he doesn’t complain about dryness, which is a win in my books.I like that it’s fragrance free - he already smells like a walking sock most days, so we don’t need any fake scents on top of that. The fact that it’s gentle but still exfoliates is great, especially for his bumpy arms (keratosis pilaris runs in the family). I sneak a pump now and then myself, and it doesn’t strip my skin either.Big bonus: no microbeads, so I’m not feeling guilty rinsing it down the drain.One bottle lasts a while, even with daily teenage overuse.\n  \nRead more\n  35 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

It lathers well, rinses off easily, and works great for both adults and teens.If you’re looking for a dermatologist-recommended body wash that actually nourishes your skin, this is it.

I'll admit that I have been a facial beauty products girl since I was eleven or twelve years old. My mother and Aunt were ALWAYS using the best high-end products and their skin was always flawless. I started using Shiseido at eleven everyday until I was probably 24 and then I switched between all high-end products including private products only available at Specialized Luxury Dermatologist's clinics in Europe. I always have used a facial soap to clean because my first Dermatologist as a young girl told me that a good quality face soap will never hurt your face and cleansing is the most important first step. His daughter is a good friend and is an up-and-coming Dermatologist, she suggested I try this CereVe face wash. I am 100% SOLD AFTER FIRST USE! It's been 2.5 weeks and my skin looks amazingly fresh ✨️ and so smooth!! I always want to wash my face because it feels so good after. 5 STARSFYI ~ I have always used various appliances on my face to add to my cleaners, for example a facial brush. I can't get over how clean my face looks with just this soap and my nose tip is even shiny after!!
