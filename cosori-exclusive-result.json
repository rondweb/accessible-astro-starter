One of the things I reflected on prior to purchase was my kids. They are old enough to cook things themselves now when they want to, and a BIG thing for them is \"Is it cooked yet, what does it now look like, what are you cooking in the air fryer\". It is not enough for them to hear you answer they have to SEE IT and would constantly open the air fryer basket to see for themselves. This window solves all these problems!!Pros:Windows: visually see what is cooking, how it looks so far, without having to open the basket.Basket Lights: Useful for visual clarity as hard to see otherwise.Cleaning: Easy cleaning with the removeable trays, non stick too.Great size: Fits two slices of bread per basket (if that helps for size reference)Sync cooking: Now dinner can be done at once vs waiting for something that wasnt cooked yet.Cooking functions: Doesn't just air fry, it has bake, broil, reheat etc.Dual Baskets: Lets you cook two different items without trying to fit them in the same basket.Cons:Price -- more expensive if not on saleControls -- Because there is more options like SHAKE mode, preheat and various cooking settings, it can be a bit complex for some people at first. I needed to practice a few times before I got the hang of it and now have zero issues with it.Summary:  If you have a family and you have ever experienced them asking what you are cooking in the air fryer, or having to open the basket to check on your food, consider this WINDOW air fyer, it will be a game changer!!\n  \nRead more\n  16 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

The standout feature is the real glass top with touch-sensitive controls, which not only work flawlessly but also add a sleek, modern touch. This appliance is both functional and visually appealing—definitely not something to hide away in a cabinet.It’s perfect for foods that typically come out of a deep fryer, like French fries and chicken fingers. The unit cooks efficiently, and I’ve found that most cooking times and temperatures can be reduced significantly. The ability to pull out the tray mid-cooking to check progress or use a food thermometer is handy, and unique to air fryers and the pull out drawer feature.Cleaning is a breeze. The removable grate is easy to clean, and the non-stick coating has held up well through repeated use. I’ve discovered the best way to clean it is to let it cool, fill it with water and dish soap, and leave it to soak overnight. This makes cleanup quick and effortless.The unit is also very quiet and has an exhaust port on the back. To minimize food odors during cooking, I’ve found placing it under a kitchen hood works great.Overall, this appliance has been a game-changer in my kitchen, so much so that it has completely replaced my toaster oven.

Cooks delicious meat etc. We have this cosori since two months and absolutely love it.  We have a Ninja dual zone as well but like this one the most for several reasons .  It looks compact but still large enough to make a decent size meal.  Portable enough that we took it to the cottage and made all our meals in it so we didn’t have to eat out, clean up is a breeze.  We like the light and window so you can check to see how far the meat is done but especially like the sleek look of the fryer. It’s very easy to use , shipping was fast. Definitely recommend.\n  \nRead more\n  25 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

After a lot of research and contacting customer support, I found that this Cosori model, compatible with the VeSync app, is a great option.Pros:* Perfect VoiceOver Integration: The VeSync app on my iPhone syncs flawlessly with the air fryer. I can easily navigate the app with VoiceOver to manually set the time and temperature, or choose from a variety of presets like \"Chicken Pro,\" \"Fries Pro,\" \"Vegetables,\" \"Steak,\" and \"Bacon Pro.\" I can also toggle the preheat function and the \"Shake Reminder\" on and off without any issues.* Convenient App Control: The ability to control the entire cooking process from my phone is a huge advantage. It's incredibly convenient to start, pause, and adjust settings without needing to be right next to the appliance.* Great Cooking Performance: The air fryer itself performs exceptionally well. I've made delicious and crispy fries without any added oil, cooked frozen steak perfectly, and gotten wonderfully crispy skin on chicken. It makes cooking these items a breeze.* Smart Home Compatibility: The product is indeed compatible with Alexa-enabled smart speakers, though this information was not easily accessible on the product page. I had to verify this with customer support.Cons & Areas for Improvement:* Inaccessible Display: The physical display on the unit is not readable with VoiceOver. I had to place a bump dot on the \"power\" and \"start/pause\" icons to be able to use the air fryer manually. While the app is fantastic, it would be much better if the physical unit's display were also accessible with tactile buttons.* Confusing Product Information: The Amazon product page and included documentation were very misleading. The product listing only says \"smart\" and does not specify compatibility with VoiceOver for iOS or TalkBack for Android. I had to contact customer support to confirm this feature.* Incorrect User Manual: The user manual provided with the unit was for a Phillips Oral-B toothbrush, and the user guide had no information about connecting to smart devices. This was frustrating and made setup more difficult than it needed to be.* Color-Specific Features: I was originally told by customer support that the smart features are only available on the white unit as indicated with the phone icone and Alexa icon on the product images..* Limited Cooking Functions: While it's great for fries, steak, and chicken, I would love to see more functions like baking and roasting for braised dishes with the other units.Summary:Despite the initial confusion with the product information and documentation, this is a fantastic air fryer for anyone who relies on VoiceOver. The seamless integration with the VeSync app makes cooking a far more accessible and enjoyable experience. The cooking results are excellent, and the added Alexa compatibility is a nice bonus. Cosori could significantly improve the user experience by making their product listings clearer, including the correct documentation, and making the physical display accessible. However, if you are a VoiceOver user looking for a smart air fryer, this is an excellent choice.\n  \nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \t\t \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n            \n                <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png\"/>Dejeiko\n            \n\n            4.0 out of 5 stars\n            \n                Compatible with Voice Over but with a few quirks\n            \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                \n                                    Reviewed in Canada on August 1, 2025\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            As a VoiceOver user, I was specifically looking for an air fryer with smart features that I could control with my iPhone.

However, if you are a VoiceOver user looking for a smart air fryer, this is an excellent choice.\n        \n        \n            \n                Images in this review\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n   function toggleSeeAllView() {\n       P.when('A', 'cr-image-popover-controller').execute(function(A, imagePopoverController) {\n          imagePopoverController.toggleSeeAllView(true);\n       });\n   }\n\n\n       <img alt=\"Customer image\" src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61t-okv2ebL._SY88.jpg\" height=\"88\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n        P.when('A', 'cr-image-popover-controller').execute(function(A, imagePopoverController) {\n          A.on(\"a:popover:beforeShow:R2VAA6JNSDK8SC_gallerySection_main\", function(data) {\n            imagePopoverController.initImagePopover(\"R2VAA6JNSDK8SC\", \"[https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61t-okv2ebL.jpg]\", data);\n          });\n        });\n    \n\n  2 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

It looks great and works great. Super easy to use- It has changed the fundamental way of using a kitchen, in the same way the microwave has. And it’s safe. You can’t really burn anything. I really like the brand as it is well built and designed with thought.
