Some other brands didn’t seem moist enough to not be unavoidably abrasive on the skin, and while I don’t have the most sensitive skin, I do show red quite easily, so these wipes were far preferable on that front.  Good price, too!As with all the wipes I have tried, I wouldn’t say that these wipes are sufficient to be used without also subsequently washing your face with actual water and a cleanser, but if you can’t get around to that this brand doesn’t feel quite as uncomfortable as the others did when not followed with a water wash.\n  \nRead more\n  3 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

This product stands out for its remarkable ability to effortlessly and effectively remove makeup, leaving my skin feeling fresh and clean.One of the standout features of this makeup remover is its gentleness. Even with my sensitive skin, I experienced no irritation or redness after use. The formula is light, non-greasy, and doesn't leave any residue, making it suitable for all skin types. It effortlessly dissolves stubborn makeup, including waterproof mascara and long-wearing foundation, without the need for excessive rubbing or tugging.The convenience of the product is another plus. The packaging is practical, and the flip-top lid ensures easy and mess-free dispensing. I appreciate how a little goes a long way, meaning the bottle lasts for a considerable amount of time, making it both effective and economical.What sets the Neutrogena Makeup Remover apart is its dual-phase formula. The combination of the oil and water-based components works like magic to break down makeup, making the removal process quick and thorough. After use, my skin feels not only makeup-free but also nourished and refreshed.In terms of its fragrance, it's fragrance-free, as promised. This is a great feature for those who prefer products with a more neutral scent.All in all, if you're on the lookout for a makeup remover that truly gets the job done without compromising on skincare, the Neutrogena Makeup Remover is a fantastic choice. Its gentle yet effective formula, user-friendly packaging, and budget-friendly nature make it a standout product in the world of makeup removers.\n  \nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \t\t \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n            \n                <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/86a403dd-ac75-4abb-ada3-9c2c6046832f._CR0%2C0%2C500%2C500_SX460_.jpg\"/>Rishi Raghuwanshi\n            \n\n            5.0 out of 5 stars\n            \n                Gentle but Powerful Makeup Remover\n            \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                \n                                    Reviewed in Canada on November 26, 2023\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            I recently added this Neutrogena Makeup Remover to my skincare routine, and it has quickly become a must-have in my beauty arsenal.

They work while being easy on the skin yet still removing 99% of my makeup. It was suggested that I use these first then additionally use a facial cleanser which I now do and my skin has improved greatly. I know it is really clean when I go to sleep !\n  \nRead more\n  \n        Report",

I LOVE make-up and use every type of make-up including all different brands.  I also use waterproof mascara from time to time vs. using regular every day.  These wipes remove the waterproof completely!  I know...crazy, right?  Also, these wipes make your skin feel so fresh and clean!  My favorite part is that it’s alcohol free and we all know alcohol based facial products cause wrinkles.  Yes...something we don’t need to say the least lol.  Another bonus is that they are gentle and refreshing for my sensitive skin.  They are the best make-up remover wipes I’ve ever used in my 23 years of wearing make-up.  Nothing tops it!\n  \nRead more\n  \n        Report",
