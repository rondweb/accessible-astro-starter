He pairs it with Benzagel 5% Acne Gel, and honestly, it’s been working well to keep the typical teenage skin drama under control. Less redness, fewer breakouts, and he doesn’t complain about dryness, which is a win in my books.I like that it’s fragrance free - he already smells like a walking sock most days, so we don’t need any fake scents on top of that. The fact that it’s gentle but still exfoliates is great, especially for his bumpy arms (keratosis pilaris runs in the family). I sneak a pump now and then myself, and it doesn’t strip my skin either.Big bonus: no microbeads, so I’m not feeling guilty rinsing it down the drain.One bottle lasts a while, even with daily teenage overuse.\n  \nRead more\n  35 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

I'll admit that I have been a facial beauty products girl since I was eleven or twelve years old. My mother and Aunt were ALWAYS using the best high-end products and their skin was always flawless. I started using Shiseido at eleven everyday until I was probably 24 and then I switched between all high-end products including private products only available at Specialized Luxury Dermatologist's clinics in Europe. I always have used a facial soap to clean because my first Dermatologist as a young girl told me that a good quality face soap will never hurt your face and cleansing is the most important first step. His daughter is a good friend and is an up-and-coming Dermatologist, she suggested I try this CereVe face wash. I am 100% SOLD AFTER FIRST USE! It's been 2.5 weeks and my skin looks amazingly fresh ✨️ and so smooth!! I always want to wash my face because it feels so good after. 5 STARSFYI ~ I have always used various appliances on my face to add to my cleaners, for example a facial brush. I can't get over how clean my face looks with just this soap and my nose tip is even shiny after!!

It’s never greasy, oily, or sticky—just a lovely, radiant glow.It keeps my makeup looking fresh throughout the workday, and if I’m heading out after, I don’t need a full redo. A few spritzes and I’m good to go! Knowing it’s vegan and cruelty-free makes me love it even more.I use it morning, night, and even mid-day for a refresh. It gives me that luminous, glass-skin look without the 10-step routine.

This product is a game-changer for anyone seeking a touch of luxury combined with effective skincare.**Scent:** The fragrance is divine! The rich, earthy aroma of white truffle is both unique and sophisticated. It adds a delightful sensory experience to my daily routine without being overwhelming. A few spritzes leave a subtle yet luxurious scent that lingers throughout the day.**Texture and Application:** The spray has a lightweight, almost watery texture that absorbs quickly into the skin. It feels refreshing and hydrating, making it perfect for morning and evening use. I love using it after cleansing my face; it provides a great base for my moisturizer.**Hydration and Benefits:** After using this spray consistently, I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture and overall hydration. It gives my skin a healthy glow and helps to prep it for makeup application. Plus, the nourishing ingredients make me feel like I'm treating my skin to something special.**Packaging:** The packaging is elegant and practical. The spray nozzle delivers a fine mist, ensuring even coverage without wasting product. It looks beautiful on my vanity, adding a touch of sophistication.Overall, the d'alba Piedmont Italian White Truffle First Spray is an indulgent addition to any skincare routine. If you’re looking for a product that not only smells amazing but also delivers on hydration and skin benefits, I highly recommend giving this a try\n  \nRead more\n  31 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

I’ll give this product credit, it definitely hydrates and softens my skin beautifully and I feel dewy all day, but that initial “wet look” lasts for a few minutes before it absorbs.  I think I expected to have that look all day but that’s my fault for being unrealistic 😝. I find the scent to be very pleasant and light and I haven’t broken out which is a good sign because I have very sensitive skin.  All in all it’s good, but don’t expect to look like the insta models 🥴\n  \nRead more\n  81 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

Not really. The smell is very strong, I spray it in one area and then go to another area so I’m not breathing in its strong scent. It does make my face feel dewy after it’s sprayed on and gives it that fresh feel\n  \nRead more\n  6 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

From the moment I put them on, they feel incredibly soothing and refreshing. I’ve been using them in the mornings when my eyes look puffy or tired, and within 15 minutes, I can see and feel the difference.The skin under my eyes feels noticeably plumper and deeply moisturized, like I’ve just had a professional treatment. They give my under-eye area a smooth, hydrated look, and help reduce that dull, tired appearance.The masks stay in place really well (no slipping!) and there’s a generous amount of serum. It absorbs nicely and doesn’t leave any sticky residue.Overall, these are a great little self-care treat that actually work. I love how refreshed and awake I look after using them. Will definitely be reordering!\n  \nRead more\n  11 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

The only downfall with these is they dont put enough serum in each packet so they dry out very quickly on the eyes. I found the night (blue) ones to have the least liquid in the packet out of all the other colors. I see from other reviews I am not the only person with this problem. We pay enough for this product, I wish grace and stella would fix this issue so we can enjoy the full benefits of their products.\n  \nRead more\n  12 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

I’ve used them a few times now, and while I can’t say I’ve seen drastic improvements (yet—I'm only a few uses in!), I wanted to share my experience so far!First off, no irritation for me, and I have super sensitive skin.  That’s a big win! I store them in the fridge, which adds an extra cooling kick. There’s something so satisfying about those chilled, relaxing vibes.  It feels like a mini escape without leaving my couch. And hey, I’m all about that self-care life, right?As for dark circles, I’m still waiting to see if they’ll work their magic long-term, but honestly, after just a few uses, I haven’t noticed a major change. Maybe with more frequent use, I'll get more noticeable results? I can’t speak to puffiness since that’s not really an issue for me, but I’m betting the fridge trick would definitely help with that!Final thoughts: If you’re looking for a relaxing, refreshing treat for your face that doesn’t irritate sensitive skin, these are totally worth trying! Will they cure dark circles right away? Probably not. But for a chilled-out, pampering experience, I’m sold.

From the very first use, I noticed such a refreshing difference—my under eyes felt soothed, hydrated, and instantly brighter. They really do tackle puffiness and dark circles like nothing else I’ve tried.What I appreciate most is how comfortable they are to wear. The gel pads stay in place (no slipping and sliding around), and the cooling sensation is so relaxing—it feels like a little spa treatment at home. After just 20 minutes, my eyes look well-rested and more awake, even on mornings after little sleep.The packaging is also fantastic—individually sealed, which makes them super convenient to toss into a travel bag or keep in my work drawer for a quick refresh. Plus, the fact that they’re vegan and cruelty-free is a big win in my book.These make such a thoughtful gift for anyone who deserves a bit of self-care, but honestly, they’re just as perfect to keep for yourself. Between the results, the quality, and the little luxury they bring to my routine, I can easily see why these are award-winning.💛 Highly recommend if you want to look more refreshed, fight undereye bags, or simply treat yourself—you will not be disappointed!\n  \nRead more\n  \n        Report",

Some other brands didn’t seem moist enough to not be unavoidably abrasive on the skin, and while I don’t have the most sensitive skin, I do show red quite easily, so these wipes were far preferable on that front.  Good price, too!As with all the wipes I have tried, I wouldn’t say that these wipes are sufficient to be used without also subsequently washing your face with actual water and a cleanser, but if you can’t get around to that this brand doesn’t feel quite as uncomfortable as the others did when not followed with a water wash.\n  \nRead more\n  3 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

This product stands out for its remarkable ability to effortlessly and effectively remove makeup, leaving my skin feeling fresh and clean.One of the standout features of this makeup remover is its gentleness. Even with my sensitive skin, I experienced no irritation or redness after use. The formula is light, non-greasy, and doesn't leave any residue, making it suitable for all skin types. It effortlessly dissolves stubborn makeup, including waterproof mascara and long-wearing foundation, without the need for excessive rubbing or tugging.The convenience of the product is another plus. The packaging is practical, and the flip-top lid ensures easy and mess-free dispensing. I appreciate how a little goes a long way, meaning the bottle lasts for a considerable amount of time, making it both effective and economical.What sets the Neutrogena Makeup Remover apart is its dual-phase formula. The combination of the oil and water-based components works like magic to break down makeup, making the removal process quick and thorough. After use, my skin feels not only makeup-free but also nourished and refreshed.In terms of its fragrance, it's fragrance-free, as promised. This is a great feature for those who prefer products with a more neutral scent.All in all, if you're on the lookout for a makeup remover that truly gets the job done without compromising on skincare, the Neutrogena Makeup Remover is a fantastic choice.

The texture is rich and buttery, but never sticky, and it melts right into my lips the second I apply it. I use it year-round—whether it’s the dry winter air or the hot summer sun, it keeps my lips soft, plump, and hydrated. I usually apply it overnight, and I always wake up with smooth, nourished lips, but it also doubles as a daytime gloss when I want a subtle shine. A little goes a long way, so the jar lasts forever. The scent is light and pleasant without being overwhelming. If you want a reliable lip mask that truly delivers, this is the one.\n  \nRead more\n  One person found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

Recommend for people with chapped lips.Pros: - Comes in a tight seal container with a small spatula. Doesn't take too much product to cover your lips. The product is on the thicker side but as expected since its supposed to stay on all night and to be removed in the morning. Lips do feel mosturized after applying the product. In my case, there is not much to remove in the morning. For the spatula, after your apply the product to your lips, the product is super sticky so I dont recommend touching it with your hands. I use paper towel to remove any product from the spatula prior to giving it a quick rinse with water.

So I ordered this, since it's meant for your lips, and it lasts much longer. So now I'm doing the water mask first (since it feels really good and calmns the skin), and then once that soaks in, I put this on. I love that it also looks like a lip gloss.

So I ordered this, since it's meant for your lips, and it lasts much longer. So now I'm doing the water mask first (since it feels really good and calmns the skin), and then once that soaks in, I put this on. I love that it also looks like a lip gloss.

It is moisturizing and feels good on the lips.  I use it throughout the day and often forget to put it on at night.  The small applicator is cute but I know eventually I will go in with my finger.  It is a good quality moisturizer however I have used other brands that are equally as good with a better price point.  This little pot of moisturizer was over $30 when I purchased it.  I haven't decided if I will purchase it again based on the price.  The product is good quality.\n  \nRead more\n  2 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",
