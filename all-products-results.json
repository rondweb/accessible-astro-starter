I started with a used Instant 6.7qt from warehouse deals, but ended up returning it immediately.  A couple of issues with it due to it being used, but one thing I noticed was that it felt a bit \"flimsy\" especially considering the size.  This one arrived the same day (originally intended as a Christmas gift) so I decided to open it up and give it a go.First thing I noticed is that it was definitely more substantial than the Instant AF.  Heavier and the basket is sturdier.  Basket is plenty large for two or 3 people (I'm solo but it's nice to have the volume and 9\" width of the basket for more even cooking).The fact that the fan speeds adjust to the type of cooking you are doing is a real improvement.  Most AFs just adjust the temperature and time.  With a difference in fan speeds, the results are more fine-tuned, so to speak.  I had considered getting the Cosori Dual Blaze with the lower element (in addition to the upper) but having seen a number of reviews showing the results not hugely different than a single upper element, I opted for this.  The reviews for this are basically 5 stars across the board, and the varying fan speed is an upgrade, IMHO.My first meal of pork chop, baby potatoes and baby carrots was very tasty!  I was able to do it all in one go, by starting with the potatoes, then adding carrots, then the chop.  The temps were close enough that everything worked out pretty well.  It will take a bit of experimenting to get my results down to where I want them, but for a first go, I would say it was a successful trial run!Note that you can't change the fan speeds independently.  They adjust with the selection of cooking mode, but since you can manually change your temps and time, that is essentially the same thing.  Pick the mode that gives you the fan speed you want, then adjust your temp/time accordingly.There is no \"shake\" reminder, but I found that my little spuds browned up nicely on the bottom anyway, even without shaking.  If you really feel you need the reminder to shake your contents, just set your initial time to half of the total, and then go and shake it then, and restart at half the time.I'm purchasing another for the gift (which I stole!) while the Black Friday sales are still on and have no hesitation recommending this to anyone.\n  \nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \t\t \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n            \n                <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png\"/>Quaydvt\n            \n\n            5.0 out of 5 stars\n            \n                Excellent machine!

After a soured experience with another new airfryer major brand/model (2000 series to be nonspecific)...I decided to try this Cosori.  I love it!  And don't miss the window, which is overrated imho!  The Cosori Turboblaze is very premium in design, feel, features, and weight.  While you cannot directly set the fan speed...it does have good settings that varies the (DC) fan speed.  It's quiet, no vibrations or rattles...and the beeps are very much tolerable and soft sounding.  Cooking performance is the same as any similar sized (wattage) air fryer...I don't think there is much difference really...it's a fan with a heating element.  The differences do come in with quality of construction, materials, and user interface...all of which affects the price of course.  All in all I don't think you can go wrong with this Cosori model...the basket is 9.25 inches square, and the tray looks to be easy to clean (I use a liner anyways).  My nit picks on this model would be the lack of a power cord clip...and it doesn't have the built in notches on the bottom for you hands when you pick it up.  Otherwise..first rate quality machine!\n  \nRead more\n  10 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

I looked at a few at the store and they all looked cheap. This one looks high end, and its not scratchable material.- I was concerned about it being touch, but its so great, works amazing- The basket is not incredibly heavy like majority of the Ninja ones. I wanted it light and it is.- The handle is thick, great for using one hand and the button is great because once I hear a click, I know its secured. So its peace of mind.- I did not wash my unit like it says by accident and it did not stink up the house whatsoever on the first use- This thing is incredibly easy to clean. Takes 2 seconds.- I cook steaks from absolute frozen state, and its incredible. The preheat option is awesome.If you want a rare steak, 385 degrees for 10-12 min each side, and its like getting it at a high end restaurant.Hands down the best airfryer on the market. I will be purchasing another as I know I will be using one for meat and another for veggies or sides.Dont be fooled into getting a dual airfryer. The power is split between them. Get a single one like this.Enjoy!\n  \nRead more\n  23 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

So easy to use.  So easy to clean.  This is my ideal air fryer.  It cooks fast and is super easy to use.  It actually cooks way faster than our last one and I find myself needing to cut some cooking times for items like frozen fries, frozen egg rolls etc (these items have air fryer time and temp on the bags).  Temperature is same.  Food cooks evenly so no hard spots.  The controls are easy and give you options so you can so more than fry.  It's still a fairly small footprint in size and fits well on my counter.  I have dropped the basket (wood floor) and was pleased to note I didn't have a scratch.  Though durable, I wouldn't recommend dropping it.  Great purchase, I got a great Prime days price. 10/10 buy again.\n  \nRead more\n  \n        Report",

Ahora sí comeré milanesas sin sentir culpa, flautas crujientes y deliciosas sin prácticamente nada de aceite, papás a la francesa hermosamente doraditas... camarones empanizados... soy feliz! Es fácil de usar y de limpiar y está lo bastante grande como para meter a cocinar un pollo mediano (cupieron 10 flautas).

One of the things I reflected on prior to purchase was my kids. They are old enough to cook things themselves now when they want to, and a BIG thing for them is \"Is it cooked yet, what does it now look like, what are you cooking in the air fryer\". It is not enough for them to hear you answer they have to SEE IT and would constantly open the air fryer basket to see for themselves. This window solves all these problems!!Pros:Windows: visually see what is cooking, how it looks so far, without having to open the basket.Basket Lights: Useful for visual clarity as hard to see otherwise.Cleaning: Easy cleaning with the removeable trays, non stick too.Great size: Fits two slices of bread per basket (if that helps for size reference)Sync cooking: Now dinner can be done at once vs waiting for something that wasnt cooked yet.Cooking functions: Doesn't just air fry, it has bake, broil, reheat etc.Dual Baskets: Lets you cook two different items without trying to fit them in the same basket.Cons:Price -- more expensive if not on saleControls -- Because there is more options like SHAKE mode, preheat and various cooking settings, it can be a bit complex for some people at first. I needed to practice a few times before I got the hang of it and now have zero issues with it.Summary:  If you have a family and you have ever experienced them asking what you are cooking in the air fryer, or having to open the basket to check on your food, consider this WINDOW air fyer, it will be a game changer!!\n  \nRead more\n  16 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

The unit cooks efficiently, and I’ve found that most cooking times and temperatures can be reduced significantly. The ability to pull out the tray mid-cooking to check progress or use a food thermometer is handy, and unique to air fryers and the pull out drawer feature.Cleaning is a breeze. The removable grate is easy to clean, and the non-stick coating has held up well through repeated use. I’ve discovered the best way to clean it is to let it cool, fill it with water and dish soap, and leave it to soak overnight. This makes cleanup quick and effortless.The unit is also very quiet and has an exhaust port on the back. To minimize food odors during cooking, I’ve found placing it under a kitchen hood works great.Overall, this appliance has been a game-changer in my kitchen, so much so that it has completely replaced my toaster oven.

Cooks delicious meat etc. We have this cosori since two months and absolutely love it.  We have a Ninja dual zone as well but like this one the most for several reasons .  It looks compact but still large enough to make a decent size meal.  Portable enough that we took it to the cottage and made all our meals in it so we didn’t have to eat out, clean up is a breeze.  We like the light and window so you can check to see how far the meat is done but especially like the sleek look of the fryer. It’s very easy to use , shipping was fast. Definitely recommend.\n  \nRead more\n  25 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

After a lot of research and contacting customer support, I found that this Cosori model, compatible with the VeSync app, is a great option.Pros:* Perfect VoiceOver Integration: The VeSync app on my iPhone syncs flawlessly with the air fryer. I can easily navigate the app with VoiceOver to manually set the time and temperature, or choose from a variety of presets like \"Chicken Pro,\" \"Fries Pro,\" \"Vegetables,\" \"Steak,\" and \"Bacon Pro.\" I can also toggle the preheat function and the \"Shake Reminder\" on and off without any issues.* Convenient App Control: The ability to control the entire cooking process from my phone is a huge advantage. It's incredibly convenient to start, pause, and adjust settings without needing to be right next to the appliance.* Great Cooking Performance: The air fryer itself performs exceptionally well. I've made delicious and crispy fries without any added oil, cooked frozen steak perfectly, and gotten wonderfully crispy skin on chicken. It makes cooking these items a breeze.* Smart Home Compatibility: The product is indeed compatible with Alexa-enabled smart speakers, though this information was not easily accessible on the product page. I had to verify this with customer support.Cons & Areas for Improvement:* Inaccessible Display: The physical display on the unit is not readable with VoiceOver. I had to place a bump dot on the \"power\" and \"start/pause\" icons to be able to use the air fryer manually. While the app is fantastic, it would be much better if the physical unit's display were also accessible with tactile buttons.* Confusing Product Information: The Amazon product page and included documentation were very misleading. The product listing only says \"smart\" and does not specify compatibility with VoiceOver for iOS or TalkBack for Android. I had to contact customer support to confirm this feature.* Incorrect User Manual: The user manual provided with the unit was for a Phillips Oral-B toothbrush, and the user guide had no information about connecting to smart devices. This was frustrating and made setup more difficult than it needed to be.* Color-Specific Features: I was originally told by customer support that the smart features are only available on the white unit as indicated with the phone icone and Alexa icon on the product images..* Limited Cooking Functions: While it's great for fries, steak, and chicken, I would love to see more functions like baking and roasting for braised dishes with the other units.Summary:Despite the initial confusion with the product information and documentation, this is a fantastic air fryer for anyone who relies on VoiceOver. The seamless integration with the VeSync app makes cooking a far more accessible and enjoyable experience. The cooking results are excellent, and the added Alexa compatibility is a nice bonus. Cosori could significantly improve the user experience by making their product listings clearer, including the correct documentation, and making the physical display accessible. However, if you are a VoiceOver user looking for a smart air fryer, this is an excellent choice.\n  \nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \t\t \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n            \n                <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png\"/>Dejeiko\n            \n\n            4.0 out of 5 stars\n            \n                Compatible with Voice Over but with a few quirks\n            \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                \n                                    Reviewed in Canada on August 1, 2025\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            As a VoiceOver user, I was specifically looking for an air fryer with smart features that I could control with my iPhone.
