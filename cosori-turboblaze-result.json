I started with a used Instant 6.7qt from warehouse deals, but ended up returning it immediately.  A couple of issues with it due to it being used, but one thing I noticed was that it felt a bit \"flimsy\" especially considering the size.  This one arrived the same day (originally intended as a Christmas gift) so I decided to open it up and give it a go.First thing I noticed is that it was definitely more substantial than the Instant AF.  Heavier and the basket is sturdier.  Basket is plenty large for two or 3 people (I'm solo but it's nice to have the volume and 9\" width of the basket for more even cooking).The fact that the fan speeds adjust to the type of cooking you are doing is a real improvement.  Most AFs just adjust the temperature and time.  With a difference in fan speeds, the results are more fine-tuned, so to speak.  I had considered getting the Cosori Dual Blaze with the lower element (in addition to the upper) but having seen a number of reviews showing the results not hugely different than a single upper element, I opted for this.  The reviews for this are basically 5 stars across the board, and the varying fan speed is an upgrade, IMHO.My first meal of pork chop, baby potatoes and baby carrots was very tasty!  I was able to do it all in one go, by starting with the potatoes, then adding carrots, then the chop.  The temps were close enough that everything worked out pretty well.  It will take a bit of experimenting to get my results down to where I want them, but for a first go, I would say it was a successful trial run!Note that you can't change the fan speeds independently.  They adjust with the selection of cooking mode, but since you can manually change your temps and time, that is essentially the same thing.  Pick the mode that gives you the fan speed you want, then adjust your temp/time accordingly.There is no \"shake\" reminder, but I found that my little spuds browned up nicely on the bottom anyway, even without shaking.  If you really feel you need the reminder to shake your contents, just set your initial time to half of the total, and then go and shake it then, and restart at half the time.I'm purchasing another for the gift (which I stole!) while the Black Friday sales are still on and have no hesitation recommending this to anyone.\n  \nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \t\t \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n            \n                <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png\"/>Quaydvt\n            \n\n            5.0 out of 5 stars\n            \n                Excellent machine!

After a soured experience with another new airfryer major brand/model (2000 series to be nonspecific)...I decided to try this Cosori.  I love it!  And don't miss the window, which is overrated imho!  The Cosori Turboblaze is very premium in design, feel, features, and weight.  While you cannot directly set the fan speed...it does have good settings that varies the (DC) fan speed.  It's quiet, no vibrations or rattles...and the beeps are very much tolerable and soft sounding.  Cooking performance is the same as any similar sized (wattage) air fryer...I don't think there is much difference really...it's a fan with a heating element.  The differences do come in with quality of construction, materials, and user interface...all of which affects the price of course.  All in all I don't think you can go wrong with this Cosori model...the basket is 9.25 inches square, and the tray looks to be easy to clean (I use a liner anyways).  My nit picks on this model would be the lack of a power cord clip...and it doesn't have the built in notches on the bottom for you hands when you pick it up.  Otherwise..first rate quality machine!\n  \nRead more\n  10 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

I looked at a few at the store and they all looked cheap. This one looks high end, and its not scratchable material.- I was concerned about it being touch, but its so great, works amazing- The basket is not incredibly heavy like majority of the Ninja ones. I wanted it light and it is.- The handle is thick, great for using one hand and the button is great because once I hear a click, I know its secured. So its peace of mind.- I did not wash my unit like it says by accident and it did not stink up the house whatsoever on the first use- This thing is incredibly easy to clean. Takes 2 seconds.- I cook steaks from absolute frozen state, and its incredible. The preheat option is awesome.If you want a rare steak, 385 degrees for 10-12 min each side, and its like getting it at a high end restaurant.Hands down the best airfryer on the market. I will be purchasing another as I know I will be using one for meat and another for veggies or sides.Dont be fooled into getting a dual airfryer. The power is split between them. Get a single one like this.Enjoy!\n  \nRead more\n  23 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

So easy to use.  So easy to clean.  This is my ideal air fryer.  It cooks fast and is super easy to use.  It actually cooks way faster than our last one and I find myself needing to cut some cooking times for items like frozen fries, frozen egg rolls etc (these items have air fryer time and temp on the bags).  Temperature is same.  Food cooks evenly so no hard spots.  The controls are easy and give you options so you can so more than fry.  It's still a fairly small footprint in size and fits well on my counter.  I have dropped the basket (wood floor) and was pleased to note I didn't have a scratch.  Though durable, I wouldn't recommend dropping it.  Great purchase, I got a great Prime days price. 10/10 buy again.\n  \nRead more\n  \n        Report",
