From the moment I put them on, they feel incredibly soothing and refreshing. I’ve been using them in the mornings when my eyes look puffy or tired, and within 15 minutes, I can see and feel the difference.The skin under my eyes feels noticeably plumper and deeply moisturized, like I’ve just had a professional treatment. They give my under-eye area a smooth, hydrated look, and help reduce that dull, tired appearance.The masks stay in place really well (no slipping!) and there’s a generous amount of serum. It absorbs nicely and doesn’t leave any sticky residue.Overall, these are a great little self-care treat that actually work. I love how refreshed and awake I look after using them. Will definitely be reordering!\n  \nRead more\n  11 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

The only downfall with these is they dont put enough serum in each packet so they dry out very quickly on the eyes. I found the night (blue) ones to have the least liquid in the packet out of all the other colors. I see from other reviews I am not the only person with this problem.

I’ve used them a few times now, and while I can’t say I’ve seen drastic improvements (yet—I'm only a few uses in!), I wanted to share my experience so far!First off, no irritation for me, and I have super sensitive skin.  That’s a big win! I store them in the fridge, which adds an extra cooling kick. There’s something so satisfying about those chilled, relaxing vibes.  It feels like a mini escape without leaving my couch. And hey, I’m all about that self-care life, right?As for dark circles, I’m still waiting to see if they’ll work their magic long-term, but honestly, after just a few uses, I haven’t noticed a major change. Maybe with more frequent use, I'll get more noticeable results? I can’t speak to puffiness since that’s not really an issue for me, but I’m betting the fridge trick would definitely help with that!Final thoughts: If you’re looking for a relaxing, refreshing treat for your face that doesn’t irritate sensitive skin, these are totally worth trying! Will they cure dark circles right away? Probably not. But for a chilled-out, pampering experience, I’m sold. I’m definitely keeping them in rotation for my spa day vibes! 💆‍♀️✨\n  \nRead more\n  21 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

From the very first use, I noticed such a refreshing difference—my under eyes felt soothed, hydrated, and instantly brighter. They really do tackle puffiness and dark circles like nothing else I’ve tried.What I appreciate most is how comfortable they are to wear. The gel pads stay in place (no slipping and sliding around), and the cooling sensation is so relaxing—it feels like a little spa treatment at home. After just 20 minutes, my eyes look well-rested and more awake, even on mornings after little sleep.The packaging is also fantastic—individually sealed, which makes them super convenient to toss into a travel bag or keep in my work drawer for a quick refresh. Plus, the fact that they’re vegan and cruelty-free is a big win in my book.These make such a thoughtful gift for anyone who deserves a bit of self-care, but honestly, they’re just as perfect to keep for yourself. Between the results, the quality, and the little luxury they bring to my routine, I can easily see why these are award-winning.💛 Highly recommend if you want to look more refreshed, fight undereye bags, or simply treat yourself—you will not be disappointed!\n  \nRead more\n  \n        Report",
