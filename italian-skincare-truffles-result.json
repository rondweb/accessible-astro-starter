This product is a game-changer for anyone seeking a touch of luxury combined with effective skincare.**Scent:** The fragrance is divine! The rich, earthy aroma of white truffle is both unique and sophisticated. It adds a delightful sensory experience to my daily routine without being overwhelming. A few spritzes leave a subtle yet luxurious scent that lingers throughout the day.**Texture and Application:** The spray has a lightweight, almost watery texture that absorbs quickly into the skin. It feels refreshing and hydrating, making it perfect for morning and evening use. I love using it after cleansing my face; it provides a great base for my moisturizer.**Hydration and Benefits:** After using this spray consistently, I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture and overall hydration. It gives my skin a healthy glow and helps to prep it for makeup application. Plus, the nourishing ingredients make me feel like I'm treating my skin to something special.**Packaging:** The packaging is elegant and practical. The spray nozzle delivers a fine mist, ensuring even coverage without wasting product. It looks beautiful on my vanity, adding a touch of sophistication.Overall, the d'alba Piedmont Italian White Truffle First Spray is an indulgent addition to any skincare routine. If you‚Äôre looking for a product that not only smells amazing but also delivers on hydration and skin benefits, I highly recommend giving this a try\n  \nRead more\n  31 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

I‚Äôll give this product credit, it definitely hydrates and softens my skin beautifully and I feel dewy all day, but that initial ‚Äúwet look‚Äù lasts for a few minutes before it absorbs.  I think I expected to have that look all day but that‚Äôs my fault for being unrealistic üòù. I find the scent to be very pleasant and light and I haven‚Äôt broken out which is a good sign because I have very sensitive skin.  All in all it‚Äôs good, but don‚Äôt expect to look like the insta models ü•¥\n  \nRead more\n  81 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",
