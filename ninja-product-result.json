My husband and I figured for the price, if the Ninja was a dud, we‚Äôd just get something else. Turns out, this is the air fryer of our dreams! It does much more than air fry (6 in 1) and after a couple weeks of use we‚Äôve determined it‚Äôs a much cleaner and efficient style to our old unit.  With a double basket and dual zone cooking option we can make two different recipes, using different settings, at the same time or make a larger batch of a single recipe. Roasted potatoes, fries, meat, reheated pizza slices and frozen items like shrimp tempura cook up beautifully. It may not be ideal for larger families, and this appliance does not replace a conventional oven, but for our family of four  (and regular guests, because teenagers) it does the job and then cleans up easily. Even my 12-yr old is willing to cook because it‚Äôs so easy and safe to use. Totally recommend!\n  \nRead more\n  21 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

You can use one or use both. They can be matched or each have its own temperature and function. The interior is no stick and washes like a dream. I do both handwashing and dishwasher for the pans. The unit looks nice sitting on the counter it does produce a lot of heat at the back so we pull it away from the wall during use.\n  \nRead more\n  7 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

I can easily prepare breakfast for my child‚Äîchicken wings in one basket and a scallion pancake in the other. Both are ready in just 20 minutes, making breakfast quick, simple, and delicious.The air fryer cooks evenly and efficiently, saving both time and effort. What‚Äôs more, the baskets are dishwasher-safe, which makes cleaning up a breeze. No more scrubbing or soaking‚Äîjust pop them in the dishwasher and you‚Äôre done.It‚Äôs also a much healthier option compared to traditional frying, as it uses little to no oil while still achieving a crispy texture. The food tastes great, and I feel better knowing it‚Äôs a safer and healthier choice for my family.Overall, this air fryer is a game-changer in my kitchen. Whether it‚Äôs making a quick breakfast, preparing snacks, or cooking dinner, it‚Äôs versatile, fast, and easy to clean. I highly recommend it for any busy family looking for convenience without compromising on taste or health.\n  \nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \t\t \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n            \n                <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png\"/>Daisy Wu\n            \n\n            5.0 out of 5 stars\n            \n                Highly recommend this air fryer!\n            \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                \n                                    Reviewed in Canada on July 2, 2025\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            The dual basket design is incredibly convenient, especially for busy mornings.

Mas o que me chama a aten√ß√£o √© o fato dele ser relativamente caro em compara√ß√£o aos que tem no mercado e o acabamento externo j√° ficou opaco na primeira lavagem! Deixo claro que segui todas as recomenda√ß√µes do fabricante, o que era para ser uma pe√ßa bonita na cozinha tem que ser escondida pois a apar√™ncia √© de ter usado ela a mais de dois anos!

I originally purchased the Gourmia Toaster Oven Air Fryer Combo but I had to send that baby back due oil leaking onto my counter.  I then decided to go with this Ninja and I am in love! It is so easy to use and so very easy to clean.  It's big and I love that I can cook 2 different types of food at once.  The Smart feature is easy to use.  Food taste is wonderful! I have made wings, chicken patties, fries and chicken thighs so far and it cooks everything to perfection!  There's no smoke and no intense heat coming out of the fryer when cooking. When I cooked the wings and the thighs, the oil just dripped on the parchment paper and I just scooped it up and dumped in the garbage - very easy and no mess.\n  \nRead more\n  \n        Report",
