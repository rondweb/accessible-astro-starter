The texture is rich and buttery, but never sticky, and it melts right into my lips the second I apply it. I use it year-round—whether it’s the dry winter air or the hot summer sun, it keeps my lips soft, plump, and hydrated. I usually apply it overnight, and I always wake up with smooth, nourished lips, but it also doubles as a daytime gloss when I want a subtle shine. A little goes a long way, so the jar lasts forever. The scent is light and pleasant without being overwhelming. If you want a reliable lip mask that truly delivers, this is the one.\n  \nRead more\n  One person found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",

Recommend for people with chapped lips.Pros: - Comes in a tight seal container with a small spatula. Doesn't take too much product to cover your lips. The product is on the thicker side but as expected since its supposed to stay on all night and to be removed in the morning. Lips do feel mosturized after applying the product. In my case, there is not much to remove in the morning. For the spatula, after your apply the product to your lips, the product is super sticky so I dont recommend touching it with your hands. I use paper towel to remove any product from the spatula prior to giving it a quick rinse with water. Depends how much you use, the jar will last me a long time.Cons: - Nothing in particular.\n  \nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \t\t \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n\n            \n                <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default.png\"/>Kevin\n            \n\n            5.0 out of 5 stars\n            \n                Great lip mask.

It is moisturizing and feels good on the lips.  I use it throughout the day and often forget to put it on at night.  The small applicator is cute but I know eventually I will go in with my finger.  It is a good quality moisturizer however I have used other brands that are equally as good with a better price point.  This little pot of moisturizer was over $30 when I purchased it.  I haven't decided if I will purchase it again based on the price.  The product is good quality.\n  \nRead more\n  2 people found this helpful\n    \n          \n              Helpful\n          \n      \n        Report",
